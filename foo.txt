Fault Invalid Post Request means that the post data that
we entered is not valid.
Recall that w
e add the information inside the body of the request,
so we need to enter something into
the request body and see
if that format matches the format expected.
 Also, you can see at the status
 code which says 400 BAD Request.
It means that the request parameters are not matching
the server parameters to get a response.
